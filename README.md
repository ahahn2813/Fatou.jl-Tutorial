# Fatou.jl-Tutorial
Computational exploration of complex dynamical systems using the Fatou.jl package, connecting theoretical results in complex analysis with numerical simulation and visualization.

## Overview
This project uses the Fatou.jl package to simulate and visualize complex dynamical systems arising in geometric function theory. The focus is on connecting rigorous mathematical definitions with computational experimentation to gain intuition and validate theoretical behavior.

## Motivation
Many results in complex dynamics are derived analytically but benefit from numerical exploration. This project demonstrates how computational tools can:
* Support theoretical reasoning
* Reveal qualitative behavior
* Provide visual intuition for abstract systems
This tutorial uses the Fatou.jl package to clearly bridge the gap between famous visualization and analysis definitions and results.

## Tools
* Julia
* Fatou.jl
* Scientific computing and visualization libraries

## Key Takeaways
* Demonstrates how computational tools can support pure mathematical research
* Highlights experience using domain-specific scientific software
* Shows ability to bridge theory and implementation
